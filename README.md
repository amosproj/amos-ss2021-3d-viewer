This project is designed to enable the computer science department of the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg to display its 50 years computer science department exhibition online.

The software to be developed shall be able to:

 &nbsp; ● View arbitrary rooms based on a 3D model\
 &nbsp; ● Allow users to walk through these rooms

## Properties

Functional properties of the software shall be:

&nbsp; &nbsp; ● The panorama shall be scalable (within a window)\
