# A simply fabulous pano-based 3D-Viewer (AMOS SS 2021)
This project is for our industry partnet Büren & Partner

The software to be developed shall be able to:

  ● View arbitrary rooms based on a 3D model
  ● Allow users to walk through these rooms

Functional properties of the software shall be:

  ● The panorama shall be scalable (within a window)
  ● Users should be able to
    ○ Rotate the panorama
    ○ Walk through a room (switches panoramas)
    ○ Switch between rooms
    ○ Switch between floors (levels)
  ● A room layout including the user’s location shall be available
  
Non-functional properties of the software shall be:

  ● Runs in most common browsers (hence Javascript/Typescript)
  ● Speedy non-frustrating interaction possible
  ● Can be integrated into other web applications
  
The computer science department would like to use this viewer to display its 50 years of computer science department exhibition on the web.
