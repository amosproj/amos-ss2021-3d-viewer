This project is designed to enable the computer science department of the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg to display its 50 years computer science department exhibition online.

The software to be developed shall be able to:

 &nbsp; ● View arbitrary rooms based on a 3D model\
 &nbsp; ● Allow users to walk through these rooms

## Properties

Functional properties of the software shall be:

&nbsp; &nbsp; ● The panorama shall be scalable (within a window)\
&nbsp; &nbsp; ● Users should be able to\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    ○ Rotate the panorama\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    ○ Walk through a room (switches panoramas)\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    ○ Switch between rooms\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    ○ Switch between floors (levels)\
&nbsp; &nbsp; ● A room layout including the user’s location shall be available
  
Non-functional properties of the software shall be:

&nbsp; &nbsp;   ● Runs in most common browsers (hence Javascript/Typescript)\
&nbsp; &nbsp;   ● Speedy non-frustrating interaction possible\
&nbsp; &nbsp;   ● Can be integrated into other web applications
  
The computer science department would like to use this viewer to display its 50 years of computer science department exhibition on the web.
